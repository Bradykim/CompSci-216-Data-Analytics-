    "# 2B: Practice\n",
    "In this exercise, you will practice solving probability problems. Many of these will be math problems. You can write your answers in Markdown cells. And you will be able to check the resulting value of your answer (when possible) using the autograder. When saving results in variables for autograder, use decimals instead of percentages (e.g. for 25%, use 0.25 not 25). Recall that you can use LaTeX to nicely format your math inside Markdown cells by enclosing equations in single dollar signs (e.g., $x^2+4=8$) for inline math or double dollar signs for centered equations like $$P(X > 5) = \\frac{1}{6}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a reference if you are new to LaTeX, see the [overleaf documentation for mathematical expressions](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/mathematical_expressions). Some particular LaTeX commands you might find useful include:\n",
    "- To write a fraction, use `\\frac{numerator}{denominator}` like $\\frac{3}{4}$\n",
    "- To write set intersection and union use `\\cap` and `\\cup` respectively like $A \\cap B$ and $A \\cup B$.\n",
    "- To write a bar over something (like a set complement) use `\\overline{}` like in $\\overline{E}$.\n",
    "- To write a subscript or superscript, use `_{}` or `^{}` as in $X_{n}$ or $X^{2}$.\n",
    "- To write a sum or product, use `\\sum` or `\\prod` as in $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$ or $\\prod_{i=1}^{n} X_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Show your work and/or briefly explain your answers. In general, you will not receive full credit for numeric answers with no accompanying work or justification (math, code, explanation).\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of the level of explanation we are expecting is if we asked you to calculate the probability that a dice roll is even or > 3 (like in the videos), we'd first expect a translation to probabilistic terms and then transformations until you find the number like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(even \\cup roll > 3) = P(even \\cup roll > 3) $$\n",
