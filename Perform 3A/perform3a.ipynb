NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.\n",

    "There are several formatting issues with the default import. Address the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `System User ID` and `System Machine ID` contain String data with the redundant information `User ID: ` and `Machine ID: ` in every row that has data. Remove these prefixes so that the columns only contain the user ids and machine ids themselves (for example, the first row should just have `yw22` in the `System User ID` column and `Carrot` in the `System Machine ID` column. \n",
    "2. The first three rows for `System Time second`, `System Memory GB` and `System Memory MB` contain numerical data but are currently formatted as strings with redundant prefix information repeating the column label and missing data represented as the string `?` instead of the Numpy `NaN` sentinel value. Fix this so that each value in the first three columns is either a single numerical value or `NaN` (note, you should use the actual `np.NaN` sentinal value, not just the String with the characters `N`, `a`, and `N`). For example, when you are done, the first three columns of the first row should all have `NaN` values, the second row should be `40`, `3`, and `382`, and so on. Note that the rows at index `400` and on have System Time recorded in minutes instead of seconds, be sure to convert these to seconds by mulitplying by 60.\n",
    "3. Currently the System Memory is split accross two columns, one for the GB and one for the MB. For example, the total memory of the first program is 3 GB and 414 MB. Instead, represent the full system memory in the `System Memory GB` column, and get rid of the `System Memory MB` column. To do so, you need to convert the values in the MB column to GB (1 MB is 0.001 GB) and add that to the GB column, then use the [`drop` method](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.drop.html). Missing values should remain missing after this transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are finished, `sys_df` should have the above issues corrected. Run both of the cells with `sys_df.head()` and `sys_df.tail()` to show the first and last few rows of your dataframe."
